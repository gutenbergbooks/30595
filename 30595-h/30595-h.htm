<h3>TEACHING A DOG FRENCH.</h3>

  <p>"N. &amp; Q." the other day (Vol. viii., p. 464.) contained a curious
  tale of a cat: will you insert as a pendent the following one of a dog?
  The supposition that D. Julio was some obnoxious Frenchman protected by
  the Government, seems necessary to account for the "teachyng a dogg
  frenche" in front of his door constituting such a dire offence. His name
  occurs, if I remember rightly, in Dr. Dee's <i>Diary</i> (Cam. Soc.), but
  I have not the book at hand to refer to. Perhaps some of your
  correspondents may inform me who he was. The original is in the Lansdowne
  MS. (114. No. 8.) in the British Museum; and the fact of its being
  amongst Lord Burleigh's papers shows that the occurrence took place
  between 1571 and 1598, the respective dates of his appointment as "l
  tresurer" and his death.</p>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE RUSSIANS.</h3>

  <p>Public attention being very particularly directed towards the Russian
  nation at the present time, a few remarks regarding some peculiarities in
  their manner of worship, &amp;c., which probably are not generally known,
  may be interesting.</p>

  <p>I have been for some time past endeavouring to determine the exact
  nature of the homage the Russians pay to the "gods"&mdash;whether they
  should be called <i>images</i> or <i>pictures</i>? and whether the
  Russians should be considered idolaters or not?</p>

  <p>Whenever a Russian passes a church, his custom is to cross himself
  (some do so three times, accompanying it with bowing). In every room in
  their houses an image (or picture) is placed in the east corner, before
  which they uncover their heads and cross themselves on entering.</p>

  <p>Their churches are filled with these their representatives of the
  deity, and it is very curious to observe a devout Russian kissing the toe
  of one, crossing himself before another, while to another he will in
  addition prostrate himself, even with his head to the ground; this latter
  is also very frequently done at intervals during the celebration of their
  services: but their churches are always open, so that if any one wants to
  pay devotion to a particular image (or picture) while no service is going
  on, he can do so.</p>

  <p>I understand that they consider they worship the deity through these
  representations. In the present day these gods are called <i>obraaz</i>,
  of which the literal translation is <i>image</i>. The old Sclavonic word
  for them is <i>eekona</i>, which was formerly in general use, and has
  exactly the same meaning, answering to the Greek word <span title="eikôn" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&iota;&kappa;&omega;&nu;</span>. As far as I can make out,
  neither of these words can be translated <i>picture</i>; but I do not
  remember to have found this point touched upon in any books I I have read
  on Russia or its religion; and hope, if any correspondent is able to give
  us farther information on the subject, he will do so.</p>

  <p>The Russians also believe in relics, in their efficacy in healing
  diseases, working other miracles, &amp;c. Notwithstanding this, a very
  short time ago, a new relic was found in the south of Russia, and a
  courier being immediately despatched with it to the Emperor at St.
  Petersburg; on his arrival, his Imperial Majesty (expecting some
  important news regarding his operations in the neighbourhood of Turkey),
  when told his errand, exclaimed, "Away with the relic! it is time to put
  an end to such nonsense." Would that this were to be carried out! But
  their superstitions seem too deeply rooted to be done away with in a
  short time.</p>

<h3>LEICESTERSHIRE EPITAPHS.</h3>

  <p>Having seen only one epitaph from this county among those which have
  appeared in "N. &amp; Q.," I annex a few specimens, which you may perhaps
  deem worth inserting in your pages.</p>

  <p>Burbage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"These pretty babes, who we did love,</p>
      <p>Departed from us like a dove;</p>
      <p>These babes, who we did much adore,</p>
      <p>Is gone, and cannot come no more."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hinckley:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My days on earth they were but few,</p>
      <p>With fever draughts and cordials few,</p>
      <p>They wasted like the morning dew."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Braunstone:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All triumph yesterday, to-day all terror!</p>
      <p>Nay, the fair morning overcast ere even:</p>
      <p>Nay, one short hour saw well and dead, War's mirror</p>
      <p>Having Death's swift stroke unperceived given."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 583 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page583"></a>{583}</span></p>

  <p>Another:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"An honest, prudent wife was she;</p>
      <p>And was always inclin'd</p>
      <p>A tender mother for to be,</p>
      <p>And to her neighbours kind."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Belgrave. This I quote from memory; it may not be verbally, but it is
  substantially correct:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Laurance Stetly slumbers here;</p>
      <p>He lived on earth near forty year;</p>

      <p>His soul forsook its house of clay,</p>
      <p>And thro' the pure ether took its way.</p>
      <p>We hope his soul doth rest in heaven.</p>
      <p class="i6">1777."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Newtown Linford, adjoining Bradgate Park. In this churchyard is a
  tombstone on which is engraved only the letters of the alphabet and the
  simple numerals. The story goes, that he who lies below, an illiterate
  inhabitant of the village in the last century, whose name, I believe, is
  now forgotten, being very anxious that, after death, a tombstone should
  be erected to perpetuate his memory, and being fearful that his relatives
  might neglect to do so, came to Leicester to purchase one himself. Seeing
  this stone in the mason's workshop (where it was used by the workmen as a
  pattern for the letters and figures), he bought it "a bargain," supposing
  it would serve his purpose as well as a new one, and after his decease it
  was placed at the head of his grave, where it now appears.</p>

  <p>All Saints' churchyard, Leicester. On two children of John
  Bracebridge, who were both named John, and died infants:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Both John and John soon lost their lives,</p>
      <p>And yet, by God, John still survives."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Throsby (<i>Hist. of Leic.</i>) relates that Bishop Thurlow, at one of
  his visitations, had the words <i>by God</i> altered to <i>thro'
  God</i>.</p>

<h3>LONGFELLOW'S "REAPER AND THE FLOWERS."</h3>

  <p>On looking over, a short time ago, a book of German songs, I was much
  struck by the similarity of thought, and even sometimes of expression,
  between the above piece from Mr. Longfellow's <i>Voices of the Night</i>,
  and a song by Luise Reichardt, a few verses of which I subjoin; as
  perhaps the song may not be known to some of your correspondents.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is a favourite theme," as Sir W. Scott says, "of laborious dulness
  to trace such coincidences, because they appear to reduce genius of the
  higher order to the usual standard of humanity, and of course to bring
  the author nearer to a level with his critics."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is not, however, with the view of detracting from the originality
  of Mr. Longfellow, that these two small pieces are put side by side; for
  possibly the song alluded to was never seen by our transatlantic
  neighbour, but merely for the purpose of showing how the poets treat the
  same, and certainly not very novel subject.</p>

  <p><i>Death of Philip III. of Spain.</i>&mdash;D'Israeli, in his
  <i>Curiosities of literature</i>, states to the effect that this kings
  fatal illness was induced by the overheating of a brazier, whereof state
  etiquette forbad the removal until the person in regular attendance
  should arrive. For this statement he quotes no authority, and
  consequently <span class="sc">Mr. Bolton Corney</span>, in his
  <i>Illustrations of the Curiosities of Literature</i> (2nd ed., p. 87.),
  discredits the story.</p>

  <p>It is singular that <span class="sc">Mr. Corney</span> should have
  forgotten that the anecdote is given by the Maréchal <!-- Page 584
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page584"></a>{584}</span>de
  Bassompierre, who was at Madrid at the time of the king's death; the
  Maréchal's informant was the Marquis de Pobar, <i>who was present at the
  scene</i>. Is not this sufficient? (See <i>Mémoires de Bassompierre</i>,

  Cologne, 1665.)</p>

  <p><i>Churchwardens.</i>&mdash;In an old scrap-book in my possession, I
  met with the following, which, should you deem it of sufficient interest,
  I shall be glad to see inserted in "N. &amp; Q." The print appears to be
  about sixty or seventy years old, and evidently from a newspaper:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The institution of churchwardens is of remote antiquity, they having
  been first appointed at the African Council, held under Celestine and
  Boniface, about the year of our Lord 423. These officers have at
  different periods been distinguished by different appellations,
  <i>Defensores</i>, <i>&OElig;conomi</i>, and <i>Præpositi Ecclesiæ</i>,
  <i>Testes Synodales</i>, &amp;c. In the time of Edward III. they were
  called Church Reves, as we read in Chaucer:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Of church reves, and of testamentes,</p>
      <p>Of contractes, and of lacke of sacramentes.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At this day they are called Churchwardens; all those names being
  expressive of the nature of the office, which is to guard, preserve, and
  superintend the rights, revenues, buildings, and furniture of the church.
  In an old churchwarden's book of accounts, belonging to the parish of
  Farringdon, in the county of Berks, and bearing date <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1518, there is the form of admitting
  churchwardens into their office at that period, in the following words:
  'Cherchye Wardenys, thys shall be your charge: to be true to God and to
  the cherche: for love nor for favor off no man wythin thys parriche to
  withold any ryght to the cherche; but to resseve the dettys to hyt
  belongythe, or else to go to the devell.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Your readers will observe that the last is a very summary kind of
  sentence. Any farther information relating to the institution of
  churchwardens<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

  <p><i>Epigram.</i>&mdash;In an old book I found this epigram, published

  political changes on the other side of the channel, and, I think,
  deserves to be rescued from oblivion by a place in the columns of "N.

  <p><i>Manifesto of the Emperor Nicholas.</i>&mdash;Some of the
  newspapers, having stated that the concluding Latin words in this
  manifesto&mdash;"Domine in te speravi, ne confundar in eternum"&mdash;are
  from the Psalms, I beg to say that these words are not taken from the
  Scriptures of either Testament, nor from the Apocrypha; but constitute
  the last verse of the "Te Deum," commencing, "We acknowledge thee to be
  the Lord," and ending, "O Lord, in thee have I trusted, let me never be
  confounded." It is usual to sing "Te Deum" after victories, but Nicholas
  begins his song <i>before</i> he achieves one: taking the <i>last</i>
  verse <i>first</i>.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM COOKWORTHY, THE INVENTOR OF BRITISH
PORCELAIN.</h3>

  <p>In endeavouring to revive the neglected memory of this good and great
  man, I have carefully looked over the chief periodicals of his day (1730
  to 1780) with very little success; perhaps because those I have at
  command, the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, <i>Universal Magazine</i>, and
  <i>Universal Museum</i>, were not those selected for his
  correspondence.</p>

  <p>If any of your readers can refer me to any papers or essays of his, or
  any details of the internal management of his China works, or of his
  public or private life, it will be doing me a great favour.</p>

  <p>What I have hitherto collected are chiefly fragmentary accounts of his
  life and character; general notices of his discovery of the China clay
  and stone, of the progress of his manufactory, and of his treatment of
  British cobalt ores; details of his experiments on the distillation of
  sea-water for use on ship-board; a treatise in detail on the divining
  rod; and several of his private letters, chiefly religious.</p>

  <p>Most of these I have thrown out in print, under the title of <i>Relics
  of William Cookworthy, &amp;c.</i>, which I am desirous of making much
  more complete.</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC FLORAL DIRECTORIES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>More than a year ago (Vol. vi., p. 503.) I made a Query respecting
  Catholic Floral Directories, and two works in particular which were
  largely quoted in Mr. Oakley's <i>Catholic Florist</i>, Lond. 1851; and I
  again alluded to them in Vol. vii., p. 402., but have not got any reply.
  The two works referred to, viz. the <i>Anthologia Borealis et
  Australis</i>, and the <i>Florilegium Sanctorum Aspirationum</i>, are not
  to be heard of anywhere (so far as I can see) save in Mr. Oakley's book.
  During the last year I have ransacked all the bibliographical authorities
  I could lay hold of, and made every inquiry after these mysterious
  volumes, but all in vain.</p>

  <p>The orthography and style of the passages cited are of a motley kind,
  and most of them read like modern compositions, though here and there we
  have a quaint simile and a piece of antique spelling. In fact they seem
  more like imitations than anything else; and I cannot resist the
  temptation of placing them on the same shelf with M&lsquo;Pherson's
  <i>Ossian</i> and the poems of Rowley. In some places a French version of
  the <i>Florilegium</i> is quoted: even if that escaped one's researches,
  is it likely that two old English books (which these purport to be), of
  such a remarkable kind, should be unknown to all our bibliographers, and
  to the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," among whom may be found the chief
  librarians and bibliographers in the three kingdoms. Is it not strange
  also that Mr. Oakley and his "compiler" decline giving any information
  respecting these books?</p>

  <p>I shall feel extremely obliged to any correspondent who will clear up
  this matter, and who will furnish me with a list of Catholic Floral
  Directories.</p>

<h3>GEORGE ALSOP.</h3>

  <p>George Alsop was ordained deacon 1666-67, priest 1669, by Henry King,
  Bishop of Chichester. He printed in 1669&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An Orthodox Plea for the Sanctuary of God, Common Service, and White
  Robe of the House. Printed for the Author, and sold by R. Reynolds, at
  the Sun and Bible in the Postern."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is a small 8vo. of eighty-six pages, exclusive of the dedication to
  the Bishop of Chichester, and an Epistle to the Reader, and has a
  portrait of the author by W. Sherwin.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers give me any account of this George Alsop, his
  preferment, if any, and the time of his death?</p>

  <p>He is, I feel persuaded, a different person from the author of <i>A
  Character of Maryland</i>, 12mo., 1666.</p>

  but not in addressing an entire stranger. In a correspondence now before
  me, one of the writers, an Italian gentleman, uses it in the subscription

  following curious circumstances:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The writ for election (of a member for the county of Bute) was
  transmitted to the sheriff, Mr. M&lsquo;Leod Bannatine, afterwards Lord
  Bannatine. He named the day, and issued his precept for the election.
  When the day of election arrived, Mr. Bannatine was the only freeholder
  present. As freeholder he voted himself chairman of the meeting; as
  sheriff he produced the writ and receipt for election, read the writ and
  the oaths against bribery at elections; as sheriff he administered the
  oaths of supremacy, &amp;c., to himself as chairman; he signed the oaths
  as chairman and as sheriff; as chairman he named the clerk to the
  meeting, and called over the roll of freeholders; he proposed the
  candidate and declared him elected; he dictated and signed the minutes of
  election; as sheriff he made an indenture of election between himself as
  sheriff and himself as chairman, and transmitted it to the crown
  office."</p>

  have been carefully handed down with other Stuart relics by my Jacobin
  fathers?</p>

  <p>They are about 4 feet long, and 1¼ inch deep, of silk woven in the
  loom; the pattern consists of a stripe of red, yellow, and blue, once
  repeated, and arranged so that the two blue lines meet in the centre. At
  each end, for about six or seven inches, and at spaces set at regular
  intervals, these lines of colour are crossed, so as to form a check or
  tartan; the spaces corresponding with the words in the following
  inscription, and one word being allotted to each space:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Come lett us with one heart agree</i>"</p>

  <p>and it is continued on the other:</p>

  this brave warrior was a native of Kent, it is scarcely probable he would
  have been a visitor at the house alluded to, unless he had relatives who
  resided there. Is he known to have had any family connexion in that
  quarter, since the fact of his having had such, if established, would
  tend to confirm the traditionary statement respecting his domicile at the

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

<div class="note">
  <p>[This work has already been incidentally noticed in our Second Volume,
  pp. 140. 220. and 476.; and in Vol. iii., p. 157. Two editions of
  Herbert's Memoirs have been published; the first in 1702, and the second
  in 1813. The edition of 1702 is the best, as it contains an
  "Advertisement to the Reader," and several documents omitted in the
  edition published by G. and W. Nicol of Pall Mall in 1813. The following
  is the title to it:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Memoirs of the Two last Years of the Reign of that unparallel'd
  Prince, of ever-blessed Memory, King Charles I. By Sir Tho. Herbert,
  Major Huntington, <!-- Page 588 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page588"></a>{588}</span>Col. Edw. Coke, and Mr. Hen. Firebrace.
  With the Character of that Blessed Martyr, by the Reverend Mr. John
  Diodati, Mr. Alexander Henderson, and the Author of the <i>Princely
  Pelican</i>. To which is added, the Death-Bed Repentance of Mr. Lenthal,
  Speaker of the Long Parliament; extracted out of a Letter written from
  Oxford, Sept. 1662. London: printed for Robert Clavell, at the Peacock,
  at the West-end of St. Paul's, 1702,"</p>

  <p>The "Advertisement to the Reader" states that, "there having been of
  late years several Memoirs printed and published relating to the life and
  actions of the Royal Martyr, King Charles I., of ever-blessed memory, it
  was judged a proper and seasonable time to publish Sir Thomas Herbert's
  <i>Carolina Threnodia</i>, under the title of his <i>Memoirs</i>, there
  being contained in this book the most material passages of the two last
  years of the life of that excellent and unparallel'd prince, which were
  carefully observ'd and related by the author in a large answer of a
  letter wrote to him by Sir William Dugdale. In the same book is printed
  Major Huntington's relation made to Sir William of sundry particulars
  relating to the King; as also Colonel Edw. Coke's and Mr. Henry
  Firebrace's narratives of several memorable passages observed by them
  during their attendance on him at Newport, in the Isle of Wight, anno
  '48. All these were copied from a MS. of the Right Reverend the Bishop of
  Ely, lately deceased; and, as I am credibly informed, a copy of the
  several originals is now to be seen amongst the Dugdale MSS. in Oxford
  library. To these Memoirs are added two or three small tracts, which give
  some account of the affairs of those times, of the character of K.
  Charles I., and of his just claim and title to his <i>Divine
  Meditations</i>. These having been printed anno 1646, 48, 49, and very
  scarce and difficult to procure, were thought fit to be reprinted for
  publick service. As to the letter which gives an account of Mr. Lenthal's
  carriage and behaviour on his death-bed, it was printed anno 1662, and
  the truth of it attested by the learned Dr. Dickenson, now living in St.
  Martin's Lane.... This I thought fit to advertise the reader of, by way
  of introduction, that he might be satisfied of the genuineness of the
  respective pieces, and thereby be encouraged to peruse them with
  confidence and assurance."]</p>

  4to. book entitled <i>The Liturgy of the Ancients represented, as near as

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. G. Lomax.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Lichfield.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Edward Stephens is the author of this Liturgy, who describes himself
  as "late of Cherington, co. Gloucester, sometime barrister-at-law of the
  Hon. Society of the Middle Temple, and since engaged, by a very special
  Divine Providence, in the most sacred employment." He farther informs us,
  that "when it pleased God to discharge him from the civil service, his
  first business in public was a gentle and tacit admonition of the neglect
  of the most solemn and peculiar Christian worship of God in this nation;
  accompanied by such public acts in the very heart of the chief city, as
  made it a most remarkable witness and testimony against them who would
  not receive it, but rejected the counsel and favour of God towards them."
  Stephens's Liturgy has been republished by the Rev. Peter Hall, in his
  <i>Fragmenta Liturgica</i>, vol. ii., who thus notices the
  author:&mdash;"Stephens was the leader of a class by no means
  contemptible, though himself as odd a mixture of gravity and scurrility,
  learning and trifling, pietism that could stoop to anything, and
  liberalism that stuck at nothing, as English theology affords." Some
  account of Edward Stephens will be found in Leslie's <i>Letter concerning
  the New Separation</i>, 1719; and in <i>An Answer to a Letter from the
  Rev. C. Leslie, concerning what he calls the New Separation</i>, 1719.
  Stephens advocated the practice of daily communion.]</p>

  <p>"<i>Ancient hallowed Dee.</i>"&mdash;What is the historical,
  traditional, or legendary allusion in this epithet, bestowed by Milton on
  the river Dee?</p>

  <p class="author">J. W. T.</p>

  <p class="address">Dewsbury.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Dee's divinity was Druidical. From the same superstition, some rivers
  in Wales are still held to have the gift or virtue of prophecy. Giraldus
  Cambrensis, who wrote in 1188, is the first who mentions Dee's sanctity
  from the popular traditions. In Spenser, this river is the haunt of
  magicians:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Dee, which Britons long ygone</p>
      <p>Did call <span class="scac">DIVINE</span>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And Browne, in his <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>, book ii. § 5.,
  says,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Never more let <span class="scac">HOLY</span> Dee,</p>
      <p class="i1">Ore other rivers brave," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Much superstition was founded on the circumstance of its being the
  ancient boundary between England and Wales; and Drayton, in his tenth
  Song, having recited this part of its history, adds, that by changing its
  fords it foretold good or evil, war or peace, dearth or plenty, to either
  country. He then introduces the Dee, over which King Edgar had been rowed
  by eight kings, relating to the story of Brutus. See more on this subject
  in Warton's note to line 55. in Milton's <i>Lycidas</i>:</p>

  <p><i>Who was True Blue?</i>&mdash;In the churchyard of Little Brickhill,
  Bucks, is a table monument bearing the following inscriptions:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Here lieth y<sup>e</sup> body of <i>True Blue</i>, who departed this
  life January y<sup>e</sup> 17th, 1724-5, aged 57. Also y<sup>e</sup> body
  of Eleanor, y<sup>e</sup> wife of <i>True Blue</i>, who departed this
  life January 21st, 1722-3, ageed (sic) 59."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Who was "True Blue?" If it were not for his wife Eleanor, one would
  take him to be some kin to "Eclipse" or "Highflyer." Lysons makes no
  mention of such a person; nor, I am assured by a friend who has made the
  search for me, does Lipscomb; although another friend referred me there
  under the conviction that he was not only named, but that his history was
  given. The kind <!-- Page 589 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page589"></a>{589}</span>of tombstone is sufficient to show that he
  was a person of some property, and yet he has not only no "Esq." affixed
  to his name, but it is without the prefix "Mr." One can scarcely doubt
  that the name is not a real one. Browns, Blacks, Whites, and Greens there
  are in abundance, but nobody ever heard of a "Blue;" nor, so far as I
  know, did anybody ever christen his child "True." Yet what could have
  been the incidents of a life that required the fiction to be carried even
  to the grave?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">G. J. De Wilde.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The foregoing monumental inscription is given in Lipscomb's
  <i>Bucks</i>, vol. iv. p. 76., to which is subjoined the following
  note:&mdash;"The singularity of this name has occasioned much curiosity;
  but no information can be obtained besides that of <i>True Blue</i>
  having been a stranger, who settled here, and acquired some property,
  which after his decease was disposed of. It has been conjectured that he
  lived here under a feigned name. One Hercules True, about 1645, kept a
  house at Windsor, to which deer-stealers were accustomed to resort; and
  he uttered violent threats against a person, whose son, having been
  killed in attempting to resist the deer-stealers in the Great Park,
  Thomas Shemonds prosecuted the murderers, and True declared he would
  knock his brains out, and is believed to have afterwards absconded."]</p>

  <p><i>Charge of Plagiarism against Paley.</i>&mdash;Has any reply been

  <i>The Athenæum</i>? It was stated (and apparently proved) that his
  <i>Natural Theology</i> was merely a translation of a Dutch work, the
  name of whose author has escaped my recollection. I suppose the
  archdeacon would have defended this shameful plagiarism on his favourite
  principle of expediency. It seems to me, however, that it is high time
  that either the accusation be refuted, or the culprit consigned to that
  contempt as a man which he deserved as a moralist.</p>

  In what volume of the <i>Athenæum</i> is the accusation against Paley
  made? and, 2. What is the title of the Dutch work supposed to be pirated?
  After pulling down six volumes of the <i>Athenæum</i>, we discovered that
  the charge against Paley appeared at p. 803. of the one for the year
  1848, and that the work said to be pirated was written by Dr. Bernard
  Nieuwentyt of Holland, and published at Amsterdam about the year 1700. It
  was translated into English, under the title of <i>The Religious
  Philosopher</i>, 3 vols. 8vo., 1718-19. The charge against Paley has been
  ably and satisfactorily discussed in the same volume of the
  <i>Athenæum</i> (see pp. 907. 933.), and at the present time we have
  neither "ample room nor verge enough" to re-open the discussion in our
  pages.]</p>

<h3>PRONUNCIATION OF HEBREW NAMES AND WORDS
IN THE BIBLE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 469.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent does not, of course, inquire what is the proper
  Hebrew pronunciation of the several <i>letters</i>, but rather what is
  the accented syllable in each word. To pronounce in a manner nearly
  approaching to the Hebrew might make the congregation stare, but would
  appear very pedantic to a learned ear. The safest mode is to examine the
  Greek of the Septuagint, <span class="correction" title="Original reads `not', corrected by errata in Issue 217."
  >or</span> of the New Testament (if the reader does not understand
  Hebrew), and observe the place of the acute accent. On that place, if it
  be on the penultimate or antepenultimate, the accent should be laid in
  English. But if the accent be on the last syllable, though it is strictly
  right to place it there also in English, it is not worth while to do so,
  for fear of making hearers talk about a strange sound, instead of
  attending to the service. It will be safer to accent the penultimate in
  dissyllables, and the antepenultimate in trisyllables, which in the Greek
  are acutitones; in fact, to pronounce, as all clergymen used to
  pronounce, until a pedantic and ignorant practice arose of lengthening,
  or rather accenting, every syllable in the penultimate, which had or was
  supposed to have a long quantity in Greek. Hence the comparatively new
  habit of pronouncing <span title="Sabaôth" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&#x1F7D;&theta;</span>, <span
  title="Zaboulôn" class="grk"
  >&Zeta;&alpha;&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&#x1F7D;&nu;</span>, <span
  title="sabachthani" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&chi;&theta;&alpha;&nu;&#x1F77;</span>, <span
  title="Akeldama" class="grk"
  >&Alpha;&kappa;&epsilon;&lambda;&delta;&alpha;&mu;&#x1F71;</span>, with a
  strong accent on the penultima; whereas the old-fashioned way of
  accenting the antepenultima makes no one stare, and is a much nearer
  approach to the true pronunciation. There is a curious inconsistency in
  the common way of reading, in English, <span title="Samareia" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&alpha;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span> and <span
  title="Kaisareia" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&alpha;&iota;&sigma;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>.
  Samar&#x12B;a is decidedly a Greek word; but yet, in this word, it is
  usual to accent the antepenultima. Cesar&#x115;a is decidedly a Latin
  word Græcised, and yet it is usual to read this with an accent on the
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `antepenultima', corrected by errata in Issue 217."
  >penultima</span>. I never observed any of those who read Sabáoth,
  Zabúlon, and sabachtháni, read either Samaría or Cesárea. The Greek
  accents on Hebrew words always accord, as Hebraists know, with the tonic
  accent in that language.</p>

  <p class="author">E. C. H.</p>

  <p>As a contribution to the desirable object of settling the
  pronunciation of the words mentioned, the following representation of
  their pronunciation in the originals is offered. The vowels are to be
  read as in Italian, the <i>th</i> as in English, and the <i>hh</i> as

  <p>The <i>conventional</i> pronunciation given by Walker is perhaps best
  adapted to English ears, which would be quite repulsed by an attempt to
  restore the ancient pronunciation of such familiar words, for instance,
  as Jacob, Isaac, Job, and Jeremiah.</p>

<h3>LORD HALIFAX AND CATHERINE BARTON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 429. 543.)</p>

  <p>One has some doubt, in reading <span class="sc">Professor De
  Morgan's</span> article on the above subject, what inference is to be
  drawn from it. If it is to prove a private marriage between Halifax and
  Mrs. Barton, on the strength of the date on the watch at the Royal
  Society being falsified, it is a failure. I have examined that watch
  since <span class="sc">Professor De Morgan</span> published his Note, and
  can testify most decidedly that, if anything, the inscription is older
  than the case, nor is there a vestige of anything like unfair alteration;
  and any one accustomed to engraving would arrive at the same conclusion.
  The outside case is beautifully chased in Louis Quatorze style: but the
  inner case, on which the inscription is graven, has no need of such
  elaborate work, nor is such work ever introduced on the inside of
  watches; they are invariably smooth.</p>

  <p>And all that is noticeable in the present instance is, that the
  writing has lost the sharpness of the graver by use, or returning it into
  its case; or more probably the case has not been used at all, being
  cumbersome and set aside as a curious work of art, which indeed it
  is.</p>

  <p>The date on the watch is 1708, and <span class="sc">Professor De
  Morgan</span> states that Mrs. Barton was married in 1718; the watch
  therefore denies this; but when she married Conduit ought, if possible,
  to be found out by register, which might prove the watch date untrue; but
  the watch declares she was Mrs. Conduit in 1708. She was then of course
  twenty-eight years of age: thus we come to a <!-- Page 591 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page591"></a>{591}</span>plainer conclusion that
  when she lived with Halifax, or whatever other arrangement they made, a
  position which is said to have occurred between 1700 and the time of
  Halifax's death in 1715, she was really Mrs. Conduit, and not Catherine
  Barton. And thus we are brought to think that if there is any private
  marriage in the case, it is between the lady and Mr. Conduit; at all
  events she went back to her husband, if the watch is true.</p>

  <p>As to an apology for Newton, I look upon it in a very different light:
  first, I should say he had no clear right to interfere in the matter, as
  the lady was married; and supposing he had, he could have done no more
  than expostulate. He lived in a world of his own studies, and did not
  choose to be interrupted by quarrels and scandals. And it is certainly a
  proper addition to say, that the public morals of that age are not to be
  judged by the present standard. All these account very well for Newton's
  silence on the subject; but to settle the matter, some search might be
  made in the registers of the parishes where they resided, in order that
  the subject may be fully explained.</p>

<h2>PRAYING TO THE WEST.</h2>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 343. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>The setting sun and the darkness of evening has been immemorially
  connected with death, just as the rising orb and the light of morning
  with life. In Sophocles (<i>&OElig;dipus Rex</i>, 179.), Pluto is called
  <span title="hesperos theos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F15;&sigma;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &theta;&epsilon;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>; and the "Oxford translation" has
  the following note on the line:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Lysia's Oration against Andocides is this passage: To expiate this
  pollution (the mutilation of the <!-- Page 592 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page592"></a>{592}</span>Hermæ), the priestesses
  and priests <i>turning towards the setting sun, the dwelling of the
  infernal gods</i>, devoted with curses the sacrilegious wretch, and shook
  their purple robes, in the manner prescribed by that law, which has been
  transmitted from the earliest times."&mdash;Mitford, <i>History of
  Greece</i>, ch. xxii.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Liddell and Scott consider <span title="Erebos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F1C;&rho;&epsilon;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (the nether gloom)
  to be derived from <span title="erephô" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&rho;&#x1F73;&phi;&omega;</span>, to cover; akin to <span
  title="eremnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&rho;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, and probably also
  to Hebrew <i>erev</i> or <i>ereb</i>, our <i>eve</i>-ning; and mention as
  analogous the Egyptian Amenti, <i>Hades</i>, from <i>ement</i>, the west.
  (Wilkinson's <i>Egyptians</i>, ii. 2. 74.)</p>

  <p>Turning to the East on solemn occasions is a practice more frequently
  mentioned. There is an interesting note on the subject in the Translation
  above quoted, at &OElig;dipus Col., 477.,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="choas cheasthai stanta pros prôtên heô" class="grk"

</blockquote>

  <p>and doubtless much more may be found in the commentators. The custom,
  as is well known, found its way into the Christian Church.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The primitive Christians used to assemble on the steps of the
  basilica of St. Peter, to see the first rays of the rising sun, and
  kneel, curvatis cervicibus in honorem splendidi orbis. (S. Leo. Serm.
  VII. <i>De Nativ.</i>) The practice was prohibited, as savouring of, or
  leading to, Gentilism. (Bernino, i. 45.)"&mdash;Southey's <i>Common-Place

  Constitutions, never obtained in Italy, where the churches are turned

</blockquote>

  <p>In the Reformed Church in England the custom is <i>recognised</i>, as
  far as the position of the material church goes. (See rubric at the
  beginning of the Communion Service.) "The priest shall stand at the
  <i>north side</i> of the table;" but turning eastward at the Creeds has
  no sanction that I know of, but usage. (Compare Wheatly <i>On the Common
  Prayer</i>, ch. ii. § 3., ch. iii. § 8.; and Williams, <i>The
  Cathedral</i> ("Stanzas on the Cloisters"), xxiv.-xxviii.)</p>

  <p>The <i>rationale</i> of western paradise is given in the following
  extract, with which I will conclude:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the stream of mankind was flowing towards the West, it is no
  wonder that the weak reflux of positive information from that quarter
  should exhibit only the impulses of hope and superstition. Greece was
  nearly on the western verge of the world, as it was known to Homer; and
  it was natural for him to give wing to his imagination as he turned
  towards the dim prospects beyond.... All early writers in Greece believed
  in the existence of certain regions situated in the West beyond the
  bounds of their actual knowledge, and, as it appears, of too fugitive a
  nature ever to be fixed within the circle of authentic geography. Homer
  describes at the extremity of the ocean the Elysian plain, "where, under
  a serene sky, the favourites of Jove, exempt from the common lot of
  mortals, enjoy eternal felicity." Hesiod, in like manner, sets the Happy
  Isles, the abode of departed heroes, beyond the deep ocean. The Hesperia
  of the Greeks continually fled before them as their knowledge advanced,
  and they saw the terrestrial paradise still disappearing in the
  West."&mdash;Cooley's <i>History of Maritime Discov</i>., vol. i. p. 25.,
  quoted in Anthon's <i>Horace</i>.</p>

<h3>"GREEN EYES."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 407.)</p>

  <p>In the edition of Longfellow's <i>Poetical Works</i> published by
  Routledge, 1853, the note quoted by Mr. Temple ends thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dante speaks of Beatrice's eyes as <i>emeralds</i>
  (<i>Purgatorio</i>, xxxi. 116.). Lami says, in his <i>Annotazioni</i>,
  'Erano i suoi occhi d' un turchino verdiccio, simile a quel del
  mare.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>More in favour of "green eyes" is to be found in one of Gifford's
  notes on his translation of the thirteenth satire of <i>Juvenal</i>. The
  words in the original are:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cærula quis stupuit Germani lumina."&mdash;<i>Juv.</i> Sat. <span
  class="scac">XIII</span>. 164.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Gifford's note is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ver. 223 ... and <i>eyes of sapphire blue</i>?]&mdash;The people of
  the south seem to have regarded, as a phenomenon, those blue eyes, which
  with us are so common, and, indeed so characteristic of beauty, as to
  form an indispensable requisite of every Daphne of Grub Street. Tacitus,
  however, from whom Juvenal perhaps borrowed the expression, adds an
  epithet to <i>cærulean</i>, which makes the common interpretation
  doubtful. 'The Germans,' he says (<i>De Mor. Ger.</i> 4.), 'have
  <i>truces et cærulei oculi</i>, fierce, lively blue eyes.' With us, this
  colour is always indicative of a soft, voluptuous languor. What, then, if
  we have hitherto mistaken the sense, and, instead of blue, should have
  said sea-green? This is not an uncommon colour, especially in the north.
  I have seen many Norwegian seamen with eyes of this hue, which were
  invariably quick, keen, and glancing.</p>

  <p>"Shakspeare, whom nothing escaped, has put an admirable description of
  them into the mouth of Juliet's nurse:</p>

<h3>THE MYRTLE BEE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 173. 450.)</p>

  <p>Allow me to thank <span class="sc">C. Brown</span> for the reply he
  has sent to my inquiries on this subject. I shall certainly avail myself
  with pleasure of the permission he has given me to communicate with him
  by letter; but before doing so, I hope you will allow me to address him
  this note through the medium of your pages. The existence of the Myrtle
  Bee as a distinct species has been denied by ornithologists, and as I
  think the question is more likely to be set at rest by public than by
  private correspondence, I trust <span class="sc">C. Brown</span> will not
  consider that I am presuming too much on his kindness if I ask him to
  send me farther information on the following points: What was the exact
  size of the bird in question which he had in his hand? What was its size
  compared with the Golden-crested Wren? Was it generally known in the
  neighbourhood he mentions, and by whom was it known? By the common people
  as well as others? From what source did he originally obtain the
  appellation "Myrtle Bee," as applied to this bird? It has been suggested
  to me that the bird seen by C. Brown may have been the Dartford Warbler
  (<i>Sylvia provincialis</i>, Gmel.), wings short, tail elongated (this,
  if the Myrtle Bee is the Dartford Warbler, would account for its
  "miniature pheasant-like appearance"); a bird which, as we are informed
  in Yarrell's <i>Hist. of British Birds</i>, 1839, vol. i. p. 311. <i>et
  seq.</i>, haunts and builds among the furze on commons; flies with short
  jerks; is very shy; conceals itself on the least alarm; and creeps about
  from bush to bush. This description would suit the Myrtle Bee. Not so the
  colour, which is chiefly greyish-black and brown; whereas the bird seen
  by your correspondent was "dusky light blue." Nor again does the
  description of the Dartford Warbler, "lighting for a moment on the very
  point of the sprigs" of furze (vid. Yarrell <i>ut sup.</i>), coincide
  with the account of the bird seen by <span class="sc">C. Brown</span>,
  who "never saw one sitting or light on a branch of the myrtle, but
  invariably flying from the base of one plant to that of another." In
  conclusion I would venture to ask whether your correspondent's memory may
  not have been treacherous respecting the colour of a bird which he has
  not seen for twenty-five years, and whether he has ever seen the Dartford
  Warbler on Chobham or the adjacent commons?</p>

<h3>TIN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 290. 344.).</p>

  <p>The first mention I remember of the place from whence tin came, is in
  Herodotus (lib. iii. c. 115.). He there says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But concerning the extreme parts of Europe towards the west, I am not
  able to speak certainly. For I neither believe that a certain river is
  called Eridanus by the barbarians, which flows into a northern sea, and
  from which there is a report that the amber is wont to come, nor have I
  known (any) islands, being Cassiterides (<span title="kassiteridas eousas" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F77;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F10;&omicron;&#x1F7B;&sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>), from which the
  tin is wont to come to us. For, on the one hand, the very name Eridanus
  proves that it is Hellenic and not Barbaric, but formed by some poet; and
  on the other, I am not able, though paying much attention to this matter,
  to hear of any one that has been an eye-witness that a sea exists upon
  that side of Europe. But doubtless both the tin and the amber are wont to
  come from the extreme part of Europe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span title="Kassiteros" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&#x1F77;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  according to Damm, is so called because it is more ready to melt than
  other metals, i.&nbsp;e. <span title="kausiteros" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  from <span title="kaiô" class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F77;&omega;</span>,
  to burn; this derivation agrees with that given by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crossley</span> of tin, "from the Celtic tin, to melt readily;" and it
  receives some support from Hesiod (<i>D.&nbsp;G.</i> 861.), where he speaks of
  the earth burning and melting as tin or as iron, which is the hardest of
  metals.</p>

  <p>But I own I doubt this derivation. First, <!-- Page 594 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page594"></a>{594}</span>because it is quite
  clear to my mind that Herodotus had no idea that it had a Greek
  derivation. He assigns the Greek origin of the word Eridanus as a reason
  for disbelieving the statement as to it; and had he known that Cassiteros
  had a like origin, it cannot be doubted that he would have assigned the
  same reason as to it likewise. Instead of which he resorts to the fact
  that he could not obtain any authentic account of any sea on that side of
  Europe, as a proof that the Cassiterides did not exist. In truth, his
  assertion as to the Greek origin of the one, coupled with the reason that
  is added, seems almost, if not quite, equivalent to a denial that the
  other had a Greek origin. Secondly, it is in the highest degree
  improbable that these islands should have received their name from the
  Greeks, as it is contrary to all experience that a country should be
  named by persons ignorant of its existence. The names of places are
  either given to them by those who discover them, or the names by which
  they are called by their inhabitants are adopted by others.</p>

  <p>At the time Cæsar invaded this island, there was a people whom he
  calls Cassi (<i>Cæs. de B.&nbsp;G.</i>, lib. v. 21.), of whose prince Camden
  says, "from the Cassii their prince, Cassivellaunus or Cassibelinus,
  first took his name;" and he adds that "it seems very probable that
  Cassivellaunus denotes as much as the Prince of the Cassii." (<i>Camd.
  Brit.</i>, p. 278., edit. 1695.) According to which the word would be
  compounded of <i>Cassi</i> and <i>vellaunus</i> or <i>belinus</i>; and
  this derivation is fortified by the word Cunobelinus, which plainly is
  formed in a similar manner. Now there is a Celtic word, <i>tir</i> or
  <i>ter</i> (from which <i>terra</i> is derived), and the Welsh word
  <i>tir</i> (which I have heard pronounced <i>teer</i>), all denoting
  land. If then this word be added to Cassi, we have Cassiter, that is, the
  land of the Cassi, Cassiland. And as we have England, Scotland, and
  Ireland, possibly the ancient inhabitants may have called their country
  Cassiter; and as <i>chalybs</i>, steel, was so called both by the Greeks
  and Romans from the people that made it, so might tin be from the country
  where it was found. My derivation is conjectural, no doubt, and as such I
  submit it with great deference to the candid consideration of your
  readers.</p>

  <p>Isaiah, who lived <span class="scac">B.C.</span> 758, mentions tin in
  i. 25.</p>

  <p>Ezekiel, who lived <span class="scac">B.C.</span> 598, mentions tin
  xxii. 18. 20.; and xxvii. 12., speaking of Tyre, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of
  riches; with silver, iron, <i>tin</i>, and lead, they traded in thy
  fairs."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This passage clearly shows that, at the time spoken of by Ezekiel, the
  trade in tin was carried on by the inhabitants of Tarshish, whether that
  place designates Carthage, or Tartessus in Spain, or not; and there can
  be little doubt that they brought the tin from England; and the addition
  of silver, iron, and lead, tends to strengthen this opinion.</p>

  <p>Herodotus recited his History at the Olympic Games, <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> 445; and probably the same people traded in tin
  in his time as in the time of Ezekiel.</p>

  <p>The Hebrew word for tin is derived from a verb meaning "to separate,"
  and seems to throw no light on the subject.</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 452. 544. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondents <span class="sc">Mr. Marsh</span> and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> are entitled to an apology from me for
  having so long delayed noticing their comments on my communication on the
  above subject in Vol. viii, p. 134., which comments have failed in
  convincing me that I have fallen into the error they attribute to me,
  because it is manifest Richard Minshull of Chester, son of Richard of
  Wistaston, the writer of the letter of May 3rd, 1656, set forth in the
  Rev. Mr. Hunter's <i>Milton Pamphlet</i>, pp. 37. and 38., could only
  have been <i>fifteen</i> years old when that letter was written, he
  having, as <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> states, been born in 1641,
  so that he must have been only three years the junior of his supposed
  niece, Mrs. Milton, then Miss Minshull, born in 1638, according to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Marsh's</span> account of her baptism; and furthermore he,
  Richard, <span class="correction" title="Inserted by errata in Issue 218."
  >son of</span> the writer of the said letter, must be fairly presumed to
  have been married at the date of such letter, which he <span
  class="correction" title="Inserted by errata in Issue 218.">(the
  Father)</span> thus commences: "My love and best respects to you and my
  daughter [meaning no doubt his daughter-in-law], tendered with trust of
  your health." Very unlikely language for a parent to address to his son,
  a boy of <i>fifteen</i>, on so important a subject as a family pedigree.
  If this youthful Richard Minshull really was Mrs. Milton's uncle, his
  brother Randle Minshull, her father, must have been very many years older
  than him, which was not very probable.</p>

  <p>I noticed in a recent Number of your pages, with great satisfaction, a
  communication from <span class="sc">Cranmer</span>, who has avowed
  himself to be your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Arthur
  Paget</span>, for which, in common with <span class="sc">Mr.
  Hughes</span> and others, I feel very thankful to him, notwithstanding it
  falls short of connecting Mrs. Milton with Richard Minshull of Wistaston,
  the Holme correspondent of 1656.</p>

  <p>That historians have been much misled in assuming that Mrs. Milton was
  a daughter of Sir Edward Minshull of Stoke, cannot, I think, be
  questioned; although it may be very fairly asked whether there were not
  other respectable Minshull families living in the neighbourhood of
  Wistaston, of which Mrs. Milton might have been a member, and yet allied
  to the Paget and Goldsmith families.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Garlichithe.</span></p>

<p><!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page595"></a>{595}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span> is quite right, both in his facts,
  so far as they go, and in the inference he draws from them in
  confirmation of the now well ascertained identity of Milton's widow with
  the daughter of Randle Mynshull of Wistaston. His observations derive
  additional force from the fact, that two generations of Minshull of
  Wistaston married ladies of the name of Goldsmith. Thomas Minshull, the
  great-grandfather of Milton's widow, married &mdash;&mdash; Goldsmith of
  Nantwich, as his son Richard informed Randal Holmes, in a letter among
  the Harl. MSS., noticed by <span class="sc">Mr. Hunter</span>, and as
  pointed out by <span class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span>; but the writer of that
  letter also married a lady of the same name, Elizabeth, daughter of
  Nicholas Goldsmith, of Bosworth, in the county of Leicester. The fact is
  worth noticing, though no very accurate estimate can be formed of the
  precise degree of relationship to be inferred from the title of "cousin"
  a couple of centuries ago. My authority is the Cheshire visitation of
  1663-4. Several other MS. pedigrees are in existence; in some of which
  the lady's name is stated as Ellen, instead of Elizabeth, and her
  father's as Richard instead of Nicholas. Thomas Minshull of Manchester,
  the uncle of Milton's widow, deserves perhaps a passing word of notice,
  as having embalmed the mortal remains of Humphrey Chetham.</p>

  <p>Our elegant poet Fenton, having written a <i>Life of Milton</i>, and
  no doubt often visited his place of nativity (Shelton, in the
  Staffordshire Potteries), he surely must have known <i>something</i>
  respecting <i>Milton's</i> third wife's family, who lived only a few
  miles from thence; and if the Fenton papers have, as is probable, been
  preserved by his family, some of whom I am informed still live in the
  neighbourhood of Shelton, it is not unlikely they will throw some light
  on the family of the poet's widow.</p>

<h3>BOOKS CHAINED TO DESKS IN CHURCHES&mdash;OLD
PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 93.)</p>

  <p>On a recent visit to Aberystwith, I walked to the mother church of
  Llanbadarn, a fine old building, which I was glad to find, since a former
  visit, was undergoing important repairs in its exterior. While inspecting
  the interior, I requested the clerk to show me into the vestry, and upon
  inquiring if the church possessed any black-letter Bible, Foxe's
  <i>Martyrs</i>, or any of those volumes which at the Reformation were
  chained to the desks or pews, he opened a case in the vestry, in which I
  was sorry to observe many volumes, not of that early date, but about a
  century and a half old, yet valuable in their day as well as at present,
  in a sad dilapidated state, arising from the dampness of the room, which
  is without a fire-place. Many of the volumes were the gift of a Doctor
  Fowle, with his autograph, stating that they were given as a lending
  library to the parishioners.</p>

  <p>The present incumbent is the Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Hughes, a very
  excellent and zealous pastor, with the modern church in Aberystwith
  annexed, who should this narrative meet his eye, or be communicated to
  him, might be induced to make inquiries into the losses which had taken
  place, and prevent farther dilapidations and decay, in what was no doubt,
  once considered a valuable acquisition to the inhabitants of the
  parish.</p>

  <p>Permit me to add, that in a room over the entrance porch of that
  venerable Saxon church St. Peter in the East, at Oxford, there is a large
  lending library for the use of the parishioners, largely contributed to
  by several of its recent and present zealous incumbent, and to which
  church so much has lately been done to remove former eye-sores, and to
  render it one of the most chastely decorated and best attended parish
  churches in the University.</p>

<h3>THE COURT-HOUSE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 493.)</p>

  <p>This place is not "an old out-of-the-way place," as described to
  F.&nbsp;M., but stands in a paddock adjoining the churchyard, in the town of
  "Painswick, in Gloucestershire." It is a respectable old stone-built
  house in the Elizabethan style; and stands on an eminence commanding a
  view of one of the pleasant valleys which abound in this parish. I do not
  know of, and do not believe that there is, any "full description of it."
  Neither of the county histories, of Atkyns (1712), Rudder (1779), Rudge
  (1803), or Fosbrook (1807), mentions the court-house, though probably it
  is referred to by Atkyns as "a handsome pleasant house adjoining the
  town, [then] lately the seat of Mr. Wm. Rogers."</p>

  <p>If either Charles I. or II. slept there, it was doubtless King Charles
  I., on the night of the 5th of September, 1643, on which day he raised
  the siege of Gloucester, and</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thousands of the royalist army marched in the rain up Painswick hill,
  on the summit of which they encamped in the ancient entrenchment of the
  part called Spoonbed hill. On this hill, tradition says, as Charles was
  sitting on a stone near the camp, one of the princes, weary of their
  present life, asked him 'When should they go home?' 'I have no home to go
  to,' replied the disconsolate king. He went on to Painswick, and passed
  the night there."&mdash;<i>Bibliotheca Gloucestriensis</i> (Webb),

  to the colloquy.</p>

  <p>The lodge, an old wooden house, in this parish more properly deserves
  the character of an "old out-of-the-way house." I remember it many years
  ago, when it contained a court, in which were galleries approached by
  stairs, and leading to the sleeping-rooms of the mansion; such as were
  formerly in the court-yard of the Bull and Mouth Inn, London, and are now
  in the yard of the New Inn, Gloucester.</p>

<h3>ON THE SIMPLICITY OF THE CALOTYPE PROCESS,
BY DR. DIAMOND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Read before the Photographic Society, Nov. 3, 1853.)</p>

  <p>I feel that some few words are required to explain to the Society the
  reasons which have induced me to call their attention to a branch of
  photography, which of all others has been dwelt upon most fully, and
  practised with such success by so many eminent photographers.</p>

  <p>The flourishing state of this Society, which is constantly receiving
  an accession of new Members, indicates the great number that have lately
  commenced the practice of photography, and to those I hope my
  observations will not prove unacceptable, because of all others the
  calotype process is undoubtedly the simplest, and the most useful; not
  only from that simplicity, but from its being available when other modes
  could not be used.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I am also induced to urge on the attention of the Society the
  advantages of this, one of the earliest processes, because I think that
  there has been lately such an eager desire for something new, that we all
  have more or less run away from a steady wish to improve if possible the
  original details of Mr. Fox Talbot; and have been tempted to practise new
  modes, entailing much more care and trouble, without attaining a
  correspondingly favourable result.</p>

  <p>Amongst antiquaries I have long noticed, that many who have especially
  studied one particular <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page597"></a>{597}</span>branch of archæology, think and speak
  slightingly of those departments in which they are not much interested.
  One fond of research in the early tumuli is esteemed to be a mere "pot
  and pan antiquary" by one who, in his turn, is thought to waste his time
  on "mediæval trash;" and this feeling pervades its many sections.</p>

  <p>I hope I shall not give offence in saying, that amongst photographers
  I have noticed somewhat of a similar spirit, namely, an inclination to
  value and praise a production, from the particular mode of operation
  adopted, rather than from its intrinsic merits. The collodion, the waxed
  paper, or the simple paper processes have merits pertaining to themselves
  alone; and those who admire each of these several processes are too apt
  to be prejudiced in favour of the works produced by them.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding farther, permit me to observe, that if some of my
  remarks appear <i>too</i> elementary, and <i>too</i> well known by many
  assembled here, my reason for making them is, that I have myself
  experienced the want of <i>plain simple rules</i>, notwithstanding the
  many able treatises upon the subject which have already been written: I
  hope, therefore, I shall receive their pardon for entering fully into
  detail, because a want of success may depend upon what may appear most
  trivial.</p>

  <p>I think the greatest number of failures result from not having good
  iodized paper; which may be caused by</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The quality of the paper;</p>
      <p>2. The mode of preparing it;</p>
      <p>3. The want of proper <i>definite</i> proportions for a particular make of paper;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>because I find very different results ensue unless these things are
  relatively considered.</p>

  <p>I have not met with satisfactory results in iodizing the French and
  German papers, and the thick papers of some of our English makers are
  quite useless.</p>

  <p>Turner's paper, of the "Chafford Mills" make, is greatly to be
  preferred, and therefore I will presume that to be used, and of a medium
  thickness. The great fault of Turner's paper consists in the frequent
  occurrence of spots, depending upon minute portions of brass coming from
  the machinery, or from the rims of buttons left in the rags when being
  reduced to pulp, and thus a single button chopped up will contaminate a
  large portion of paper; occasionally these particles are so large that
  they reduce the silver solutions to the metallic state, which is formed
  on the paper; at other times they are so minute as to simply decompose
  the solution, and white spots are left, much injuring the effect of the
  picture.</p>

  <p>Whatman's paper is much more free from blemishes, but it is not so
  fine and compact in its texture; the skies in particular exhibiting a
  minutely speckled appearance, and the whole picture admitting of much
  less definition.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>All papers are much improved by age; probably in consequence of a
  change which the size undergoes by time. It is therefore advisable that
  the photographer, when he meets with a desirable paper, should lay in a
  store for use beyond his immediate wants.</p>

  <p>It may not be inappropriate to mention here, in reference to the
  minuteness attainable by paper negatives, that a railway notice of six
  lines is perfectly legible, and even the erasure for a new secretary's
  name is discernible in the accompanying specimen, which was obtained with
  one of Ross's landscape lenses, without any stop whatever being used, and
  after an exposure of five minutes <i>during a heavy rain</i>. The sky is
  scarcely so dense as could be desired, which will be fully accounted for
  by the dull state of the atmosphere during the exposure in the
  camera.</p>

  <p>Having selected your paper as free from blemishes as possible, which
  is most readily ascertained by holding it up to the light (as the
  rejected sheets do perfectly well for positives, it is well to reject
  <i>all</i> those upon which <i>any</i> doubt exists), mark the smoothest
  surface;&mdash;the touch will always indicate this, but it is well at all
  times not to handle the surfaces of papers more than can be avoided.
  There is much difference in various individuals in this respect; some
  will leave a mark upon the slightest touch, whereas others may rub the
  paper about with perfect impunity.</p>

  <p>I prefer paper iodized by the single process; because, independently
  of the case and economy of time, I think more rapidity of action is
  attained by paper so treated, as well as that greater intensity of the
  blacks, so requisite for producing a clear picture in after printing.</p>

  <p>To do this, take sixty grains of nitrate of silver and sixty grains of
  iodide of potassium, dissolve each separately in an ounce of distilled
  water, mix and stir briskly with a glass rod so as to ensure their
  <i>perfect</i> mixture; the precipitated iodide of silver will fall to
  the bottom of the vessel; pour off the fluid, wash once with a little
  distilled water, then pour upon it four ounces of distilled water, and
  add 650 grains of iodide of potassium, which <i>should</i> perfectly
  redissolve the silver and form a clear fluid. Should it not (for
  chemicals differ occasionally in their purity), then a little more should
  be very cautiously added until the fluid is perfectly clear.</p>

  <p>The marked side of the paper should then be carefully laid upon the
  surface of this fluid in a proper porcelain or glass dish. Then
  immediately <!-- Page 598 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page598"></a>{598}</span>remove it, lay it upon its dry side upon a
  piece of blotting-paper, and stroke it over once or twice with a glass
  rod; this as effectually expels all the particles of air as complete
  immersion; it is also more economical, and has the advantage of requiring
  much less time in the after-immersion in the hypo. when it is required to
  remove the iodide. Either pin the paper up, or lay it down upon its dry
  side, and when it becomes tolerably dry (perfect dryness is not
  requisite), immerse it in common cold water for the space of four hours,
  changing the water during that time three or four times, so that all the
  soluble salts may be removed; often move the papers, so that when several
  sheets are together, one does not press so much upon another that the
  water does not equally arrive at all the surface.</p>

  <p>If this paper is well made, it is of a pale straw colour, or rather
  primrose, and perfectly free from unevenness of tint. It will keep good
  for several years; if, however, the soluble salts have not been
  <i>entirely</i> removed, it attracts damp, and becomes brown and useless
  or uncertain in its application.</p>

  <p>Some of our oldest and most successful operators still adhere to and
  prefer the iodized paper prepared by the double process, which certainly
  effects a saving in the use of the iodide of potassium. The following is
  the easiest way of so preparing it:&mdash;Having floated your marked
  surface of the paper on a 30-grain solution of nitrate of silver, and
  dried it<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>,
  immerse it for 20 minutes in a solution of iodide of potassium of 20
  grains to the ounce, when it immediately assumes the desired colour. It
  is then requisite, however, that it should undergo the same washing in
  pure water as the paper prepared by the single process.</p>

  <p>Upon the goodness of your iodized paper of course depends your future
  success. Although it is not requisite to prepare it by candle-light
  (which in fact is objectionable from your inability to see if the yellow
  tint is equally produced), I think it should not be exposed to too strong
  a light; and as the fly-fisher in the dull winter months prepares his
  flies ready for the approaching spring, so may the photographer in the
  dull weather which now prevails, with much advantage prepare his stock of
  iodized paper ready for the approach of fine weather.<a
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Many other ways of iodizing paper have been recommended which have
  proved successful in different hands. Dr. Mansell, of Guernsey, pours the
  iodide solution upon his paper, which previously has had all its edges
  turned up so as to resemble a dish; he rapidly pours it off again after
  it has completely covered the paper, and then washes it in three waters
  for only ten minutes in all: he considers that thereby none of the size
  of the paper is removed, and a more favourable action is obtained. In the
  experiments I have tried with the use of the air-pump, as recommended by
  Mr. Stewart, I have met with much trouble and little success; and I am
  inclined to attribute the very beautiful specimens which he has produced
  to his own good manipulation under a favourable climate.<a
  name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To excite the paper take 10 drops (minims) of solution of
  aceto-nitrate of silver, and 10 drops of saturated solution of gallic
  acid, mixed with 3 drachms of distilled water.</p>

  <p>The aceto-nitrate solution consists of&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Times by steamer." title="Times by steamer.">
<tr><td class="qspcsingle">Nitrate of silver </td><td class="qspcsingle" style="text-align:right">30 </td><td class="qspcsingle">grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="qspcsingle">Glacial acetic acid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="qspcsingle" style="text-align:right">1 </td><td class="qspcsingle">drachm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="qspcsingle">Distilled water<a name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> </td><td class="qspcsingle" style="text-align:right">1 </td><td class="qspcsingle">ounce.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>If the weather is warm, 6 drops of gallic acid to the 10 of
  aceto-nitrate will suffice, and enable the prepared excited paper to be
  kept longer.</p>

  <p>This exciting fluid may be applied either directly <!-- Page 599
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page599"></a>{599}</span>by means of
  the glass rod, or by floating, as before, and then the glass rod. But if
  floating is resorted to, then a larger quantity must be prepared. As soon
  as it is applied the paper should be blotted off by means of
  blotting-paper (which should never be used more than once in this way,
  although preserved for other purposes), and put into the dark frames for
  use.<a name="footnotetag8" href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> It is not
  requisite that the paper should be perfectly dry. This exciting should be
  conducted by a very feeble light; the paper is much more sensitive than
  is generally supposed; in fact, it is then in a state to print from by
  the aid of gas or the light of a common lamp, and very agreeable
  positives are so produced by this negative mode of printing.</p>

  <p>I would advise the aceto-nitrate of silver and the solution of gallic
  acid to be kept in two bottles with wooden cases differing in their
  shape, so that they may not be mistaken when operating, in comparative
  darkness. A ¼ of an ounce of gallic acid put into such a 3-ounce bottle,
  and <i>quite</i> filled up with distilled water as often as any is used,
  will serve a very long time.</p>

  <p>I would also recommend that the paper should be excited upon the
  morning of the day upon which it is intended to be used; no doubt the
  longer it is kept, the less active and less certain it becomes. I have,
  however, used it successfully eight days after excitement, and have a
  good negative produced at that length of time. The general medium time of
  exposure required is five minutes. In the negatives exhibited, the time
  has varied from three minutes to eight, the latter being when the day was
  very dull.</p>

  <p>The pictures should be developed by equal quantities of the
  aceto-nitrate of silver and the saturated solution of gallic acid, which
  are to be mixed and immediately applied to the exposed surface. This may
  be done several hours after the pictures have been removed from the
  camera. Care should be taken that the back of the picture does not become
  wetted, as this is apt to produce a stain which may spoil the printing of
  the positive.</p>

  <p>If upon the removal of the paper from the dark frame, the picture is
  very apparent, by first applying little gallic acid, and immediately
  afterwards the <i>mixed</i> solutions, less likelihood is incurred of
  staining the negative, which will be more evenly and intensely developed.
  If a browning take place, a few drops of strong acetic acid will
  generally check it.</p>

  <p>Should the picture be very tardy, either from an insufficient
  exposure, want of light, or other cause, a few drops of a solution of
  pyrogallic acid, made with 3 grains to the ounce of water, and a drachm
  of acetic acid, will act very beneficially. It sometimes gives an
  unpleasant redness upon the surface, but produces great intensity upon
  looking through it. Until the pyrogallic solution was added, there was
  scarcely anything visible upon the specimen exhibited, the failure having
  in the <i>first</i> instance happened from the badness of the iodized
  paper.</p>

  <p>As soon as the picture is sufficiently developed it should be placed
  in water, which should be changed once or twice; after soaking for a
  short time, say half an hour, it may be pinned up and dried, or it may at
  once be placed in a solution almost saturated, or quite so, of
  hyposulphite of soda, remaining there no longer than is needful for the
  entire removal of the iodide, which is known by the disappearance of the
  yellow colour.</p>

  <p>When travelling it is often desirable to avoid using the hyposulphite,
  for many reasons (besides that of getting rid of extra chemicals), and it
  may be relied on that negatives will keep even under exposure to light
  for a very long time. I have kept some for several weeks, and I believe
  Mr. Rosling has kept them for some months.</p>

  <p>The hyposulphite, lastly, should be effectually removed from the
  negative by soaking in water, which should be frequently changed.</p>

  <p>Some prefer to use the hypo, quite hot, or even boiling, as thereby
  the size of the paper is removed, allowing of its being afterwards
  readily waxed.<a name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  I have always found that pouring a little boiling water upon the paper
  effectually accomplishes the object; some negatives will readily wax even
  when the size is not removed. A box iron very hot is best for the
  purpose; but the most important thing to attend to is that the paper
  should be perfectly dry, and it should therefore be passed between
  blotting-paper and well ironed before the wax is applied. Negatives will
  even attract moisture from the atmosphere, and therefore this process
  should at all times be resorted to immediately before the application of
  the wax.</p>

  <p>Some photographers prefer, instead of using wax, to apply a solution
  of Canada balsam in spirits of turpentine. This certainly adds much to
  the transparency of the negative; and, in some instances, may be very
  desirable. Even in so simple a thing as white wax, there is much <!--
  Page 600 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page600"></a>{600}</span>variety; some forming little flocculent
  appearances on the paper, which is not the case with other samples.
  Probably it may be adulterated with stearine, and other substances
  producing this difference.</p>

  <p>Before concluding these remarks, I would draw attention to the great
  convenience of the use of a bag of yellow calico, made so large as to
  entirely cover the head and shoulders, and confined round the waist by
  means of a stout elastic band. It was first, I believe, used by Dr.
  Mansell. In a recent excursion, I have, with the greatest ease, been
  enabled to change all my papers without any detriment whatever, and
  thereby dispensed with the weight of more than a single paper-holder. The
  bag is no inconvenience, and answers perfectly well, at any residence you
  may chance upon, to obstruct the light of the window, if not protected
  with shutters.</p>

  <p>I would also beg to mention that a certain portion of the bromide of
  silver introduced into the iodized paper seems much to accelerate its
  power of receiving the green colour, as it undoubtedly does in the
  collodion. Although it does not accelerate its <i>general</i> action, it
  is decidedly a great advantage for foliage. Its best proportions I have
  not been able accurately to determine; but I believe if the following
  quantity is added to the portion of solution of iodide of silver above
  recommended to be made, that it will approach very near to that which
  will prove to be the most desirable. Dissolve separately thirty grains of
  bromide of potassium, and 42 grains of nitrate of silver, in separate
  half-ounces of distilled water; mix, stir well, and wash the precipitate;
  pour upon it, in a glass measure, distilled water up to one ounce; then,
  upon the addition of 245 grains of iodide of potassium, a clear solution
  will be obtained; should it not, a few more grains of the iodide of
  potassium will effect it. It may be well to add that I believe neither of
  the solutions is injured by keeping, especially if preserved in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>I would here offer a caution against too great reliance being placed
  upon the use of gutta-percha vessels when travelling, as during the past
  summer I had a bottle containing distilled water which came into pieces;
  and I have now a new gutta-percha tray which has separated from its
  sides. This may appear trivial, but when away from home the greatest
  inconvenience results from these things, which may be easily avoided.<a
  name="footnotetag10" href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Dishes of zinc painted or japanned on the interior surface answer
  better than gutta-percha, and one inverted within another forms, when
  travelling, an admirable lid-box for the protection of glass bottles,
  rods, &amp;c. On the Continent wooden dishes coated with shellac varnish
  are almost entirely used.</p>

  <p>In a communication I formerly addressed to my friend the Editor of "N.
  &amp; Q.," one of the arguments I used in favour of the collodion process
  was, that the operator was enabled at once to know the results of his
  attempts; and was not left in suspense concerning the probable success,
  as with a paper picture requiring an after development.</p>

  <p>I made that observation not only from the partial success which had
  then attended my own manipulations, but from the degree of success which
  was attained by the majority of my photographic friends. But that
  objection is now almost entirely removed by the comparative certainty to
  which the paper process is reduced.</p>

  <p>For this purpose, strips of wood from 1 inch to 1½ square will be
  found much more convenient to pin the paper to than the tape or string
  usually recommended. The pressure of a corner of the paper to the wood
  will render it almost sufficiently adherent without the pin, and do away
  with the vexation of corners tearing off.</p>

  <p>Some difference of opinion seemed to exist at the reading of the
  paper, as to the propriety of preparing iodized paper long before it was
  required for use, and I have since received some letters from very able
  photographers who have attributed an occasional want of success to this
  cause. I have, however, never myself seen good iodized paper deteriorated
  by age. Many friends tell me they have used it when several years old;
  and I can confirm this by a remarkable instance. On Tuesday (Dec. 6) I
  was successful in obtaining a perfectly good negative in the usual time
  from some paper kindly presented to me by Mr. Mackinly, and which has
  been in his possession since the year 1844. I should add, the paper bears
  the mark of "J. Whatman, 1842," and has all the characters of Turner's
  best photographic paper. It appears to be a make of Whatman's paper which
  I have not hitherto seen, and, from its date, was evidently not made for
  photographic purposes.</p>

  <a name="footnote6"></a><b>Footnote 6:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag6">(return)</a>
  <p>The paper may be iodized by pouring over it 30 minims of the iodizing
  solution, and then smoothing it over with the glass rod. Care must
  however be taken not to wet the back of the paper, as an unevenness of
  depth in the negative would probably be the result.</p>

  <p>Much more attention should be paid to the purity of the distilled
  water than is generally supposed. In the many processes in which
  distilled water is used, there is none in which attention to this is so
  much required as the calotype process. I mention this from having lately
  had some otherwise fine negatives spoiled by being covered with spots,
  emanating entirely from impurities in distilled water purchased by me
  during a late excursion into the country.</p>

  <p>It is very requisite that the glasses of the frames should be
  thoroughly cleansed before the excited papers are put into them. Although
  not perceptible to the eye, there is often left on the glass (if this

  itself by stains upon the negative.</p>

  <p>If boiling water is carefully poured in the negative in a porcelain

  <p><i>Belike</i> (Vol. viii., p. 358.).&mdash;The reasoning by which
  H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. supports his conjecture that "belike" in <i>Macbeth</i> is
  formed immediately by prefixing <i>be</i> to a supposed verb,
  <i>like</i>, to lie, is ingenious, but far from satisfactory. In the
  first place, we never used <i>to like</i> in the sense of <i>to lie</i>,
  the nearest approach to it is <i>to lig</i>. And in the next place, the
  verb to <i>like</i>, to please, to feel or cause pleasure, to approve or
  regard with approbation, as a consequential usage (agreeably to the Dutch
  form of Liicken (Kilian), to <i>assimilate</i>), is common from our
  earliest writers. Instances from Robert of Gloucester, Chaucer, and
  North, with instances also of <i>mislike</i>, to displease, may be found
  in Richardson and others in Todd's <i>Johnson</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, when we have a word well established in various usage (as
  <i>like</i>, similis), from which other usages may be easily deduced, why
  not adopt that word as the immediate source, rather than seek for a new
  one? That <i>like</i>, now written <i>ly</i>, is from <i>lic</i>, a
  corpse, <i>i.e.</i> an essence, has, I believe, the merit of originality;
  so too, his notion that <i>corpse</i> is an <i>essence</i>, and the more,
  as emanating from a rectory, which probably is not far removed frown a
  churchyard.</p>

  <p>H. C. K., it is very <i>likely</i>, is right in his conception that
  all his three <i>likes</i> "have had originally one and the same source;"
  but he does not appear inclined to rest contented with the very
  sufficient one in our parent language, suggested by Richardson (in his
  8vo. dictionary), the Gothic <i>lag-yan</i>; A.-S. <i>lec-gan</i>, or
  <i>lic-gan</i>, to lay or lie.</p>

  <p>I should interpret <i>belike</i> (for so I should write it with
  H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K.) by "approve."</p>

  <p><i>What is the Origin of "Getting into a Scrape?"</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  292.).&mdash;It may have been, first, a tumble in the mire; by such a
  process many of us in childhood have both literally and figuratively "got
  into a scrape." Or, secondly, the expression may have arisen from the use
  of <i>the razor</i>, where to be shaved was regarded as an indignity, or
  practised as a token of deep humiliation. D'Arvieux mentions an Arab who,
  having received a wound in his jaw, chose rather to hazard his life, than
  allow the surgeon to take off his beard. When Hanun had shaved off half
  the beards of David's servants, "David sent to meet them, because they
  were greatly ashamed: and the king said, 'Tarry at Jericho until your
  beards be grown, and then return'" (2 Sam. x. 4, 5.). The expedient of
  <i>shaving off the other half</i> seems not to have been thought on,
  though that would naturally have been resorted to, had not the indignity
  of being rendered beardless appeared intolerable. Under this figure the
  desolation of a country is threatened. "In the same day shall the Lord
  shave with a razor that is hired, by them beyond the river, even by the
  King of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall consume
  the beard" (Isaiah vii. 20.). Again, as a token of grief and humiliation:
  "Then Job arose and rent his mantle, and shaved his beard,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;"There came fourscore men, having their heads shaven, and
  their clothes rent, and having cut themselves," &amp;c. (Jer. xli. 5.).
  Or, thirdly, the allusion may be to the consequence of becoming infected
  with some loathsome cutaneous disease. "So Satan smote Job with sore
  boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. And he took him a
  potsherd to <i>scrape</i> himself withal" (Job ii. 7, 8.).</p>

  <p><i>High Dutch and Low Dutch</i> (Vol. viii., p. 478.).&mdash;Nieder
  Deutsch, or rather Neder Duitsch, is the proper name of the Dutch
  language; at least it is that which the people of Holland give to it. Low
  German does not necessarily mean a vulgar patois. It is essentially as
  different a language from High German, or rather more so, as Spanish is
  from Portuguese. I believe German purists would point out Holstein,
  Hanover, Brunswick (not Dresden), as the places where German is most
  classically spoken. I wish one of your German (not Anglo-German) readers
  would set us right on this point. The term Dutch, as applied to the
  language of Holland as distinguished from that of German, is a
  comparative modernism in English. High Dutch and Low Dutch used to be the
  distinction; and when Coverdale's <i>Translation of the Bible</i> is said
  to have been "compared with the Douche," German, and not what we now call
  Dutch, is meant. Deutsch, in short, or Teutsch, is the generic name for
  the language of the Teutones, for whom Germani, or Ger-männer, was not a
  national appellation, but one which merely betokened their warlike
  character.</p>

  <p><i>Lovett of Astwell</i> (Vol. viii., p. 363.).&mdash;Since I wrote on
  this subject, I have consulted Baker's excellent <i>History of
  Northamptonshire</i>, and I find the pedigree (vol. i. p. 732.) fully
  bears out my strictures on Betham and Burke's account of Thomas Lovett,
  and his marriage with Joan Billinger. With regard to Elizabeth Boteler,
  Mr. Baker simply states that Thomas Lovett, Esq., of Astwell, married to
  his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Boteler, Esq., of Watton
  Woodhall, Herts; but I observe that (<i>Idem.</i> vol. i. p. 730.) there
  is in Wappenham Church (the parish of which Astwell is hamlet) a brass to
  the memory of "Constance, late the wife of John Boteler, Esq., and sister
  to Henry Vere, Esq., who died May 16, 1499:" this lady, I conjecture, was
  the mother of Elizabeth Boteler, afterwards Lovett; and her daughter must
  have been heir to her mother, as the arms of Vere and Green are quartered
  on her grandson Thomas Lovett's tombstone in the same church; as well as
  on another monument of the Lovetts, the inscription of which is now
  obliterated. The pedigree of the Botelers in Clutterbuck (<i>Herts</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 475.) does not give this marriage; but John Boteler, Esq., of
  Watton Woodhall, who was of full age in 1456, and whose first wife
  Elizabeth died Oct. 28, 1471, is said to have married to his second wife
  Constance, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Downhall of Gedington, co.
  Northamptonshire. Can this be the lady buried at Wappenham? She was the
  mother of John Boteler, Esq., Watton Woodhall, Sheriff of Herts and Essex
  in 1490; therefore her daughter would not be entitled to transmit her
  arms to her descendants. Or could the last-mentioned John Boteler, who
  died in 1514, have had another wife besides the three mentioned in
  Clutterbuck? There can be no question that one of the two John Botelers
  of Watton Woodhall married Constance de Vere, as the marriage is
  mentioned on the monument at Wappenham. I hope some of your genealogical
  readers may examine this point.</p>

  <p><i>Irish Rhymes</i> (Vol. viii., p. 250.).&mdash;In "The Wish,"
  appended to <i>The Ocean</i> of Young (afterwards suppressed in his
  collected works, but quoted by Dr. Johnson), are the following
  rhymes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3hg3">"Oh! may I <i>steal</i></p>
      <p class="i3">Along the <i>vale</i></p>
      <p>Of humble life, secure from foes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Have what I <i>have</i>,</p>
      <p>And live not <i>leave</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And yet again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3hg3">"Then leave one <i>beam</i></p>
      <p class="i3">Of honest <i>fame</i>,</p>
      <p>And scorn the labour'd monument."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in his "Instalment" (which shared the same fate as "The
  Wish"):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Oh! how I long, enkindled by the <i>theme</i>,</p>
      <p>In deep eternity to launch thy <i>name</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Young was no "Mil<i>a</i>sian:" so these rhymes go to acquit Swift of
  the Irishism attributed to him by <span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>;
  as, taken in connexion with those used by Pope and others, it is clear
  they were not uncommon or confined to the Irish poets. At the same time,
  I cannot think them either elegant or musical, nor can I agree with one
  of your correspondents, that their occasional use destroys the sameness
  of rhyme. If poets were to introduce eccentric rhymes at pleasure, to
  produce variety, the shade of Walker would I think be troubled
  sorely.</p>

  Oosterdijk Schacht (Boerhaave's cotemporary), delivered by him September
  12, 1729, when he entered on the professorship at Utrecht. From this it
  will appear that the words ascribed to Boerhaave may be attributed to
  other learned men:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At that time two brothers, who were extremely rich, sold their
  inheritance by the advice of Crato the philosopher, and bought diamonds
  of singular value, which they crushed in the Forum before all the people,
  thus making an ostentatious exhibition of their contempt for the world.
  St. John, happening to be passing through the Forum, witnessed this
  display, and, pitying the folly of these misguided men, kindly gave them
  sounder advice. Sending for Crato their master, who had led them into
  error, he blamed the wasteful destruction of valuable property, and
  instructed him in the true meaning of contempt for the world according to
  Christ's doctrine, quoting the precept of that teacher, his own Master,
  when, in reply to the young man who inquired of Him how he might obtain
  eternal life, He said, 'If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that
  thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;
  and come and follow me.' Crato the philosopher, acknowledging the
  soundness of the apostle's teaching, entreated him to restore the jewels
  which had been foolishly crushed to their former condition. St. John then
  gathered up the precious fragments, and, while he held them in his hand,
  prayed for some time with his eyes raised to heaven. His prayer being
  concluded, and all the faithful present having said <i>Amen</i>, the
  broken pieces of the jewels became so closely united, that there remained
  not the slightest appearance of any fracture. Then Crato the philosopher,
  with all his disciples, threw himself at the apostle's feet, believed,
  and were baptized; and Crato, preaching openly the faith of the Lord
  Jesus, became a true philosopher. Moreover, the two brothers who before
  destroyed their property to no purpose, now, in obedience to the
  evangelical precept, sold their jewels, and distributed the price in alms
  to the poor of Christ. And a multitude of believers began to attach
  themselves to St. John, and to follow his steps."&mdash;<i>Ordericus

  being at Orlton. From his correspondence with Sir William, it appears
  that he rendered him much assistance in his works.</p>

  <p><i>Pronunciations of "Coke" and "Cowper"</i> (Vols. iv. and v.
  <i>passim</i>; Vol. vi., p. 16.).&mdash;So much, and so well to the
  purpose, has already been said in "N. &amp; Q.," in support of the
  averment that the former of these names was originally pronounced
  <i>Cook</i>, that it may appear needless to adduce additional evidence;
  still, considering the source from which the testimony I am now bringing
  forward is derived, I think I may stand excused for recurring to the
  subject. It is from the Court Books of the manor of Mitcham (the
  birthplace of Sir Edward Coke), and from the parochial registers; in
  which, and, indeed, in all cotemporary records where sound was followed
  in the spelling, I find the name of this family written <!-- Page 604
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page604"></a>{604}</span><i>Cook</i> or
  <i>Cooke</i>. The great Sir Edward's own baptismal register is thus
  entered&mdash;1551, Feb. 7. "Edward Cooke genero." Surely this is
  conclusive. The same pronunciation was vulgarly followed almost up to the
  present time. There must be many who remember at the Norfolk elections
  the cry of "Cook for ever," as well as that of the opposite political
  party who threw up their caps for <i>Woodhouse</i>; for so
  <i>Wodehouse</i> was in like manner pronounced. Again, the Hobarts,
  another Norfolk family, were always called <i>Hubbarts</i>; and more
  anciently Bokenham, <i>Buckenham</i>, Todenham, <i>Tuddenham</i>, and
  others I could name, showing that in the Norfolk dialect the usage was in
  pronunciation to soften the <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>Now as regards the sound of Cowper, the same class of authorities, old
  deeds, court rolls, and parish registers, appears to lead to a different
  conclusion from that of your other correspondents. We have now no
  <i>Cowper</i> family of Norfolk origin; of <i>Coopers</i> we have
  multitudes: the names of whose forefathers were written <i>Couper</i> or
  <i>Cowper</i>; and if written as pronounced, the analogical inference is
  that the original pronunciation was <i>Cowper</i>, Cooper being merely
  the modern way of spelling; and curiously enough, the parish of
  <i>Hoo</i>, in this county, is called and now usually spelt
  <i>How</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Unkid</i> (Vol. viii., p. 353.).&mdash;<i>Unketh</i>,

  <i>uncoudy</i>, which he explains, dreary; and <i>coudy</i>, i.&nbsp;e. couth,
  couthy, nearly allied to <i>cuth</i>, notus (see <i>couth</i> (could),
  <i>uncouth</i>, <i>unketh</i>, in Richardson; and <i>coudy</i>,
  <i>uncoudy</i>, in Jamieson). Lye has "<i>Uncwid</i>, solitary; whence,
  perhaps, the not entirely obsolete <i>unkid</i>." Grose also tells us
  that, in the north, <i>uncuffs</i> and <i>uncuds</i> mean news. It is
  very plain that these are all the same word, differently written and
  applied.</p>

  He lies on his left side, resting on his hip and elbow, the left hand
  supporting his head. The figure is in armour, with a red loose coat
  without sleeves over it, a girdle and buckle, oblong shield, helmet, and
  gilt spurs. The right hand rests on the edge of the shield. This monument
  was brought many years ago from the neighbouring church (now destroyed)
  of Norton Hautville. Sir John lived temp. Henry III. The popular story of
  him is that he was a person of gigantic strength, and that he carried,
  for a feat, three men to the top of Norton church tower, one under each
  arm, and the third in his teeth! (Collinson, vol. ii. p. 108.)</p>

  <p><i>Froissart's Accuracy</i> (Vol. viii., p. 494.).&mdash;The accuracy
  of Froissart as an historian has never been questioned, says T.&nbsp;J. This
  assertion ought not to pass without a note. If T.&nbsp;J. will look into
  Hallam's <i>Lit. of Europe</i>, ch. iii., he will find that judicious and
  learned critic comparing Froissart with Livy for "fertility of historical
  invention," or, in other words, for his unhesitatingly supplying his
  readers with a copious and picturesque statement of the details of
  events, where they were palpably out of the reach of his knowledge.</p>

  <p>As a gleaner of chivalrous gossip, and a painter of national manners,
  Froissart is perhaps unequalled. Take up his account of a campaign on the
  Scottish borders, and he relates the proceedings in his amusing style, as
  if he had been behind every bush with the Scotch, and hunting for them in
  vain with every English banner. But if his accuracy be inquired into, he
  tells you that Carlisle, which he calls Cardoel en Gales, is on <!-- Page
  605 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page605"></a>{605}</span>the Tyne,
  and was garrisoned in vain with "grand planté de Galois," to prevent the
  Scotch from passing the Tyne under its walls (vol. i. ch. xviii. xix.
  xxi.).</p>

  <p>So much by way of note; but there is a Query which I should be glad to
  see answered. Bayle (art. Froissart) quotes a German critic as affirming
  that in the Lyons edition of Froissart, by Denys Saulvage, 1559: "Omnia
  quæ Aulæ Gallicæ displicebant, deleta, vixque decimam historiæ partem
  relictam esse." Does Col. Johnes notice this inaccuracy in the edition
  generally procurable? And does he state whether he saw, or consulted, or
  received any benefit from the existence of the MS. copy of Froissart,
  once in the library of Breslaw?</p>

  that a note by Dr. Burney, in a copy of Hawkins's <i>History of

      <p class="hg3">"Hang up all the poor <i>hep</i> drinkers,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the folio edition of Ben Jonson's <i>Works</i>, published by Thomas
  Hodgkin, London, 1692, in which the "Leges Convivales" are I believe for
  the first time printed, the verses over the door of the Apollo are given,
  and the couplet runs:</p>

  <p><i>Oaths</i> (Vol. viii., p. 364.).&mdash;Your correspondent assumes
  that the act of kissing the Bible, or other book containing the Holy
  Gospels, by a judicial witness, is a part of the oath itself. Is it such,
  or is it merely an act of reverence to the book? In support of the latter
  supposition, I would quote Archdeacon Paley, who says, that after
  repeating the oath,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The juror kisses the book; the kiss, however, seems rather an act of
  reverence to the contents of the book, as in the Popish ritual the priest
  kisses the gospel before he reads it, than any part of the
  oath."&mdash;<i>Mor. and Pol. Ph.</i>, p. 193., thirteenth edition.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In none of the instances given by C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G. does kissing the book
  appear to be essential. Does not this rather favour Dr. Paley's
  explanation? which, if it be correct, would, I think, afford grounds for
  concluding that the practice of kissing the book accompanied the taking
  of ancient oaths, and is not, as C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G. suggests, an addition of later
  times.</p>

  <p>Again, may I bring forward the same authority in opposition to that
  quoted by your correspondent with reference to the origin of the term
  corporal oath:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is commonly thought that oaths are denominated corporal oaths from
  the bodily action which accompanies them, of laying the right hand upon a
  book containing the four gospels. This opinion, however, appears to be a
  mistake, for the term is borrowed from the ancient usage of touching upon
  these occasions the <i>corporale</i>, or cloth, which covered the
  consecrated elements."&mdash;P. 191.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The old custom of taking the judicial oath by merely laying the right
  hand upon the book, is undoubtedly, thinks <span class="sc">Erica</span>,
  of Pagan origin. In my humble opinion it is far too common with us to
  ascribe things to Pagan origin. I would venture to assert that the origin
  of this form of judicial oath may be traced to Deuteronomy xxi. 1-8.,
  where at the sacrifice offered up in expiation of secret murder, the
  rulers of the city nearest the spot where the corpse was found were in
  presence of the corpse to wash their hands <i>over</i> the victim, and
  say, "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it."</p>

  <p><i>Mayors and Sheriffs</i> (Vol. viii., p. 126.).&mdash;In answer to a
  <span class="sc">Subscriber</span>, there can be little or no doubt, I
  consider, but that the mayor of a town or borough is the principal and
  most important officer, and ought to have precedence of a sheriff of a
  town or borough. By stat. 5 &amp; 6 Wm. IV. cap. 76. sec. 57., it is
  enacted, "That the mayor for the time being of every borough shall,
  during the time of his mayoralty, have precedence in all places within
  the borough." As sheriffs of towns, and counties of towns, do not derive
  their appointments from the Crown, but from the councils of their
  respective towns, &amp;c. (see sec. 61. of the <!-- Page 606 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page606"></a>{606}</span>above Act), I do not
  imagine that they can legally claim precedence of mayors, on the alleged
  ground of any "representation of Majesty," in the face of the particular
  enactment above quoted; which, indeed, seems to me to give to the mayor
  within his own borough precedence of a high sheriff of a county, if
  present on any public occasion. I am not aware that the sheriff of
  borough, as such, can "<i>claim</i> to have a grant of arms, if he has
  not any previous;" although I have no doubt he may readily obtain one,

  <p><i>Mousehunt</i> (Vol. viii., p. 516.).&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Mousehunt is a little animal of the species of weasel; it has a
  very slender body, about the length of a rat, with a long hairy tail,
  bushy at the end; the back is of a reddish-brown colour, the hair long
  and smooth; the belly is white, as are also its feet; it runs very
  swiftly, swaying its body as it moves along from side to side. The head
  is short and narrow, with small ears, like those of a rat; the eyes are
  black, piercing, and very bright. Their chief food is rats, mice, young
  chickens, little birds, and eggs. They frequent mole-hills, and are often
  caught in the traps set for the moles; they are destroyed by ferrets and
  dogs. These mousehunts live, for the most part, in holes beneath the
  roots of trees, or in old buildings."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above description of the Mousehunt is given in <i>The History of a
  Field-mouse</i> by Miss Black. Should it be thought of sufficient
  authority to deserve a place in "N. &amp; Q.," the coincidence which led
  "Little Downy" to be read to a little girl on the morning of Nov. 26 will
  amuse.</p>

  <p><i>"Salus populi," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 410.).&mdash;Selden, in
  his <i>Table Talk</i> (art. <span class="sc">People</span>), states, on
  what authority I know not, that this was part of the law of XII
  Tables.</p>

  <p><i>Love Charm from a Foal's Forehead</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  292.).&mdash;The word which H.&nbsp;P. wants is <i>Hippomanes</i>. The
  reference which the Lexicons give is to Aristotle's <i>History of
  Animals</i>, viii. 23. 5.</p>

  <p>I shall be glad to have some of H.&nbsp;P.'s references to Tacitus, as I
  cannot now call one to mind. In connexion with the subject, I should like
  to know if the white star, which used to be so fashionable on horses'
  foreheads, was always or generally produced artificially.</p>

  <p><i>Land of Green Ginger</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 160. 227.). &mdash;So
  named, in all probability, from green ginger having been manufactured
  there. Green ginger was one of the favourite conserve of our ancestors,
  and great quantities of it were made in this country from dried ginger
  roots. In an old black-letter work without date, but unmistakeably of the
  sixteenth century, entitled <i>The Book of pretty C&#x14D;ceits, taken
  out of Latine, French, Dutch, and English</i>, there is a receipt "To
  make Green Ginger," commencing thus:&mdash;"Take rases of cased ginger
  and use them in this sort." I need not quote the long-winded receipt.
  Suffice it to say that dried ginger was placed in alternate layers with
  fine white sand, and the whole mass kept constantly wet until the ginger
  became quite soft. It was then washed, scraped clean, and put into sirup.
  There can be no greater difficulty in finding a derivation for the Land
  of Green Ginger, than for Pudding Lane, or Pie Corner.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Members of the <i>Camden Society</i> have just received two
  volumes, with which we doubt not all will be well pleased. The first is a
  farther portion, namely, from M to R, of Mr. Way's most valuable edition
  of the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>. A glance at the foot-notes, so rich
  in philological illustration, and a knowledge that Mr. Way's labours have
  been greatly impeded by his removal from London, where only he can meet
  with the authorities which he is obliged to consult, may well explain the
  delay which has taken place in its publication. But we doubt not that the
  Camden Council are justified in the hope which they have expressed that
  the favour with which the present portion is received, will encourage the
  editor to proceed with all possible dispatch to the conclusion of the
  work.</p>

  <p>Rich, like the <i>Promptorium</i>, in philological illustration, and
  of the highest value as a contribution to the social history of the
  thirteenth century, is the next work; and for which the Camden Members
  are indebted to the learned Vicar of Holbeach, The Rev. James Morton.
  <i>The Ancren Riwle; a Treatise on the Rules and Duties of Monastic
  Life</i>, which he has edited and translated from a Semi-Saxon MS. of the
  thirteenth century, is a work which many of our best scholars have long
  desired to see in print,&mdash;we believe we may add, that many have
  thought seriously of editing. The information to be derived from it, with
  regard to the state of society, the learning and manners, the moral and
  religious teaching, and the language of the period in which it was
  written, is so various and so important, that it is clear the Camden
  Society has done good service in selecting it for publication; while the
  manner in which it has been edited by Mr. Morton, and the translation and
  complete Glossarial Index with which he has enriched it, show that the
  Council did equally well in their choice of an editor. The work does the
  highest credit both to that gentleman and to the Camden Society.</p>

  <p>Mr Bridger, of 3. Keppel Street, Russell Square, is desirous of making
  known to our readers that he is engaged in compiling a "Catalogue of
  Privately Printed Books in Genealogy and kindred subjects," and to
  solicit information in furtherance of his design, <!-- Page 607 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page607"></a>{607}</span>more especially with
  regard to privately printed sheet pedigrees. The Catalogue will be
  printed for private distribution, and he will be happy to give a copy to
  any one who may favour him with communications.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;As usual, we have a
  large item to enter under this head to the account of that enterprising
  caterer of good and cheap books, Mr. Bohn. We have two volumes of his
  <i>Standard Library</i>, namely, Adam Smith's <i>Theory of Moral
  Sentiments; and Dissertation on the Origin of Languages, with the
  Biographical and Critical Memoir of the Author</i>, by Dugald
  Stewart&mdash;and a work of greater present interest, though in itself of
  far less importance, namely, Ranke's <i>History of Servia</i>, and his
  <i>Insurrection in Bosnia, translated from the German</i>, by Mrs. A.
  Kerr, and the <i>Slave Provinces of Turkey, chiefly from the French</i>
  of M. Cyprien Robert, a volume which will be read with eagerness in the
  present condition of the political world. <i>Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and
  Eutropius, literally translated, with Notes and a General Index</i>, by
  the Reverend J. Selby Watson, M.A., forms the new volume of the same
  publisher's <i>Classical Library</i>. Mr. Bohn has this month commenced a
  New Series under the title of Bohn's <i>British Classics</i>. The first
  work is an edition of Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i>, with the notes of
  Guizot, Wenck, and other continental writers; and farther illustrations
  by an English Churchman. In thus choosing Gibbon, Mr. Bohn has not shown
  his usual tact. He may not mean his edition to be a rival to that
  published by Mr. Murray under the editorship of Dean Milman; but he will
  find much difficulty in dissuading the reading world that it is not so
  intended. We speak thus freely, because we have always spoken so freely
  in commendation of Mr. Bohn's projects generally.&mdash;<i>Catalogue of
  my English Library, collected and described</i> by Henry Stevens, F.S.A.,
  is a catalogue of the books essential to a good English library of about
  5000 volumes, and such as Mr. Stevens, the indefatigable supplier of book
  rarities and book utilities to his American brethren, feels justified in
  recommending. It would be found so capital a Hand-book to all classes,
  that we are sorry to see it is only printed for private
  distribution.&mdash;<i>The Botanist's Word-book</i>, by G. Macdonald,
  Esq., and Dr. James Allan. This little vocabulary of the terms employed
  in the Science of Botany, which may now almost be described as the
  science of Long Names, will be found most useful by all who pursue that
  fascinating study.</p>
